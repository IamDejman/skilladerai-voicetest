Modify the existing assessment application to implement strict full-screen security measures and enhanced user flow controls.

Required Modifications

1. Full-Screen Implementation for Stage 1 Typing Test

Full-Screen Entry (Stage 1 - Typing Test)

When user clicks "Begin Typing Test":

Display a modal/alert warning: "You are about to enter full-screen mode for the assessment. Do you want to continue?"

Provide "Continue" and "Cancel" options

If "Continue": Enter full-screen mode and hide nav bar + footer

If "Cancel": Return to previous screen

2. Exit Protection System

Exit Attempt Detection: Monitor for any full-screen exit attempts during ANY stage of the test

Exit Confirmation Dialog: When user tries to exit full-screen:

Display warning: "Exiting full-screen will immediately submit your test and end the assessment. You will not be able to continue or retake any part of the test. Are you sure you want to exit?"

Provide "Stay in Test" and "Exit and Submit" options

Exit Consequences: If user confirms exit:

Immediately submit all completed portions of the test

Lock access to ALL stages (Stage 1 AND Stage 2)

Display confirmation message: "Your test has been submitted. You cannot continue the assessment."

Prevent any further access to test components

Implementation Steps

Step 1: Add Full-Screen Entry Logic

Step 2: Modify Navigation Display

Standard navigation bar and footer for non-test pages

Clean, professional interface design

Step 3: Implement Exit Detection and Lockout

Use HTML5 Fullscreen API

Implement proper event listeners for fullscreen changes

Handle browser-specific fullscreen behaviors

Account for ESC key, F11, and browser button exits

State Management

Track test progress and completion status

Persist user's exit status to prevent re-entry

Manage stage transitions and access permissions

Security Features

Error Handling

Handle browser compatibility issues with fullscreen API

Provide fallback messaging for unsupported browsers

Graceful degradation for mobile devices

Network connectivity error handling for submissions

Data Management

Clear sensitive data after submission

Implement proper data validation

Additional Considerations

Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines)

Mobile device compatibility and restrictions

Please modify the existing assessment application to implement these critical full-screen security requirements. Focus on adding the full-screen functionality to the typing test entry point and implementing the exit protection system that locks users out of all test stages upon exit.
